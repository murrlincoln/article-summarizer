Create a database that expires after 72 hours

Allow for an integration with TG/slack where I can most easily dump links into a bot and have them ready to go when I want them

Allow for an option to pass in text where links wont work (alternatively: if I pass in a threadreader link with the tweet ID will that work?)

Host it on Vercel
